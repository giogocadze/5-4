                            <p>Nestled at the foot of Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain in Wales, this hostel has a
                                rich history tied to mountaineering and the great outdoors. Originally built as a coach
                                inn in the late 1800s, it served travelers journeying through the rugged terrain of
                                Snowdonia.
                                What makes Pen-y-Pass special is its role in outdoor culture. Over the decades, it
                                became a base for legendary climbers who tackled the Snowdon Horseshoe—a challenging
                                circuit of ridges—and contributed to the development of modern mountaineering in the UK.

                                hostel. Its elegant architecture, complete with stained glass windows, carved wooden
                                staircases, and period furnishings, makes it a unique blend of history and hospitality.
